Create a short, vertical documentary-style video of a professional documentary presenter reading the following historical event:
{script}

VIDEO FORMAT:
- Aspect ratio: 9:16 (vertical)
- Duration: 8 seconds
- Realistic cinematic documentary style
- High visual coherence across frames

VISUAL APPROACH:
Depict the event indirectly, as if calmly observed rather than dramatized.
Focus on environment, setting, and subtle human presence.
Avoid explicit action or spectacle.
Let the scene feel quiet, inevitable, and grounded in time.

CAMERA & MOTION:
- Slow, natural camera movement (gentle pan, slow push, or static)
- No fast cuts
- No handheld shake
- No extreme close-ups
- Eye-level or slightly wide framing
- Pause for about 0.2 seconds before and after the video

HISTORICAL ACCURACY:
- Architecture, clothing, tools, and environment must match the time period
- No modern objects, technology, text, or symbols
- If details are uncertain, use symbolic or environmental imagery instead of literal reenactment
- Speak fast to stay within time constraints

LIGHTING & COLOR:
- Naturalistic lighting
- Muted, cinematic color palette
- No neon or exaggerated contrast
- Subtle film grain allowed

CONTENT RULES:
- No text overlays
- No subtitles
- No logos
- No watermarks
- No narration
- No UI elements
- No modern symbols

TONE:
- Calm
- Observational
- Reflective
- Timeless

GOAL:
Produce a visually restrained, historically respectful shot that can be seamlessly stitched with other clips into a documentary-style YouTube Short.
