I want to build an agentic system using LangChain which can download the "on this day" content from Wikipedia and create a video of a news reporter reading this content. 

Ensure: 
* use all libraries provided by LangChain only
* only use other libraries if LangChain does not have one for the need.
* generate downloadable zip file of the directory containing all necessary files
* generate one uv install command for all dependencies
* generate README.md file for the project
* generate pyproject.toml file for the project
* do not use langchain_classic
* use only requests library to connect to wikipedia
* use openapi llm to generate text
* use openai sora to generate video with audio
* ensure each event has a date associated with it
* ensure there is a news anchor in the video reading the news
* ensure code is written in Python
* ensure code is properly structured into modules and packages
* ensure code is organized for a LangChain agentic system
* ensure code follows LangChain conventions and best practices
* ensure code has separate directies for prompts, chains, agents, tools, and memory
* ensure all tool like things are in the tools directory
* ensure code is modular and well organized
* ensure code is well commented
* ensure code has unit tests for every class
* ensure code follows best practices
* ensure code is secure and handles errors gracefully
* ensure code follows SOLID principles
* ensure code follows DRY principles
* ensure code follows KISS principles
* ensure code follows YAGNI principles
